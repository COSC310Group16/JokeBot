# JokeBot
An interactive bot made with Rasa that tells the user jokes. The bot is a friend trying to become a comedian and the user's role is to give feedback on their jokes. 

## How to Run
 To run the bot, make sure you have `rasa` installed on `Anaconda`, and navigate to the root folder of the project, and enter `rasa train`, then once it has been trained, enter `rasa shell` to talk to the bot on the CLI

## Updates
 The bot now has a GUI, it also generates photo based memes, and responds to invalid user inputs.
