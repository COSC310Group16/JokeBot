# JokeBot
An interactive bot made with Rasa that tells the user jokes. The bot is a friend trying to become a comedian and the user's role is to give feedback on their jokes. 

## How to Run
 To run the bot, make sure you have `rasa` installed on `Anaconda`, and navigate to the root folder of the project, and enter `rasa train --augmentation 0`.
 Then once it has been trained, enter `rasa shell` to talk to the bot on the CLI! At anytime you can enter `/stop` to stop the CLI and end the session.
